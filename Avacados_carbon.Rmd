Humans put 7.8 Pg +- 0.6 of Carbon into the atmosphere through fossil fuel burning (IPCC Chapter 6 figure 6.1). An [Avocado is about 215 grams](http://www.avocadosource.com/CAS_Yearbooks/CAS_68_1984/CAS_1984_PG_109-119.pdf) (including the seed + the skin). So 7.8 Pg +- 0.6 is about 7800000000000000 g +- 600000000000000 g.
